/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a `Mutex` does not distinguish between readers or writers that
/// acquire the lock, therefore blocking any threads waiting for the lock to
/// become available. An `RwLock` will allow any number of readers to acquire
/// the lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// The priority policy of the lock is dependent on the underlying
/// implementation, and this type does not guarantee that any particular policy
/// will be used. In particular, a writer which is waiting to acquire the lock
/// in `write` might or might not block concurrent calls to `read`
///
/// The type parameter T represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that T satisfies Send to be shared across threads and Sync to allow
/// concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards returned from the locking
/// methods implement `Deref` (and `DerefMut` for the write methods) to allow
/// access to the content of the lock.
